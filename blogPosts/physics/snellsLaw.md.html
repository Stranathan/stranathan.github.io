Paths to snell's law:

* Ray model with calculus optimization
* Ray model with variational arguments
* Wavefront model with geometry

All approaches are ultimately equivalent and it's enriching to see them converge to the same result

Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a ray between two given points is the path that can be traversed in the least time
It seems strange to ascribe behavior to nature and was controversial in its time for that very reason.
integral of speed with respect to distance was a minimum

Huygen's principle

---

It feels slightly out of place to bring in Huygen's principle as it occupies some middle 
ground between ray and wave representations of light, but it's strengthening to see a relationship derived
in many disparate ways. 
It's also very elegant in that Snell's law pops out as a purely geometrical argument.

The idea is that every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points mutually interfere

Here is a picture of a wavefront as originally conceived by Huygen from Wikipedia
